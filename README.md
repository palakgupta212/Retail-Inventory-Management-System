## Quick start (local)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+ and npm
- MongoDB URI (local or Atlas)

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# set MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET in .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Notes
- Configure `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` before running.
- For production, use a secure session store and HTTPS, and configure proper CORS and environment variables.
- This scaffold is intentionally simple â€” extend it with websockets, background jobs, or cloud notifications for real-time inventory in production.
